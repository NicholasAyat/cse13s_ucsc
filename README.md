# CSE 13S - Computer Systems and C Programming

This repository contains my completed assignments for CSE 13S (Computer Systems and C Programming) taken at UC Santa Cruz in Winter 2025 with Professor Alexander Rudnick.

## Course Description

CSE 13S focuses on C programming, command line, shell programming, editors, debuggers, source code control, and other tools. The course examines basic computer systems, algorithm design and development, data types, and program structures. It develops understanding of the process model, compile-link-execute build cycle, language-machine interface, memory, and data representation.

The course is 7 credits with an integrated laboratory component.
